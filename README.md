# Fany Watch - Electromagnetic hypersensitivity scanner

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS)  is a claimed sensitivity to electromagnetic fields produced by WiFi routers and mobile phone base stations, among others. The history of EHS - previously known as “microwave syndrome” - goes back to the eighties, with the reporting of dermal reactions by video display terminal workers.

Just for experimental reasons and knowing perfectly that Electromagnetic hypersensitivity is not an accepted diagnosis confirmed by science, I’ve made an EHS WiFi Scanner. The ESP8266 watch scans WiFi signals in the environment to generate a “damage ranking” based on RSSI signal strength. 

Parts used for this project:

Heltec WiFi Kit 8 with integrated Oled https://amzn.to/3qQS6uw 
The 3.7 battery from an old disposable e-Cig.
Custom made case, available at Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4683640 
23mm wristwatch strap 

Just upload the code to the ESP8266 Heltec, connect the charged battery to GND and VIN and you are done
